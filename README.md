# Chess
A simple chess simulator, written in Notepad++ and built via JDK standard instruments. 
The app uses Swing classes for GUI and basic Java SE libraries for mechanics of the game.
The project is unfinished, as my main objective was to create chess AI opponent, based on genetic algorithms. As it is now, the AI just performs random moves.
Also there is no end to the game, as checkmate logic is not incorporated yet.
