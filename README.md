# Chess
A simple chess simulator, written in Notepad++ and built via JDK standard instruments. 
The app uses Swing classes for GUI and basic Java SE libraries for mechanics of the game.
The project is unfinished, as my main objective was to create chess AI opponent, based on genetic algorithms. As it is now, the AI just performs random moves.
The game also has no finishing condition, such as checkmate or stalemate, wich makes the game virtually endless.
Checking a player's King piece is registered by the app, however any pieces can still perform any moves, even if the King is checked.
